# Black Gold and Dull Minds: The Impact of Oil Exploration Announcements on Education in Colombia
This study investigates the impact of oil exploration announcements on dropout rates of students in the exploration areas of Colombia, with a particular focus on the gender heterogeneity effect. To identify the causal effect, we employ a Geographic Regression Discontinuity Design. The findings reveal a significant reduction in the dropout rate of elementary school pupils, with a stronger effect for girls than for boys. The results suggest that the impact of natural resources on education outcomes is a crucial issue for policymakers, and measures need to be taken to ensure that these effects are considered in the development of educational policies in the exploration areas, particularly for girls.
