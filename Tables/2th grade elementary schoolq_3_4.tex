   The analysis is based on a sample of 897 observations, with 446 located within the area of exploration announcement ($A^{T}$) and 451 located near the border but outside the area of exploration  ($A^{c}$). 
           We employ a Triangular kernel and the variance-covariance matrix estimator is computed with nearest neighbor variance estimator for heteroskedasticity-robust. The global polynomial fit in  $A^{T}$ and $A^{c}$ is of order 1, the bandwith where the global polynomial fit is of 4438.167 meters.. We estimate all coefficients using conventional, bias-corrected, and robust estimators, and we cluster standard errors at the school level. \end{tablenotes}
